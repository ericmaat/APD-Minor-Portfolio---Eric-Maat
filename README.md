# Research Projects
## Food Boost
The first project I worked on was in regards of the Food Boost case. The case focuses on eating more sustainable and healthy and peoples personal preferences towards such recipes.

# Domain Knowledge

The first project I worked on was in regards of the Food Boost case. The goal was to create a week schedule consisting of lunch and diner recipes (seven lunches and seven diners, so fourteen recipes in total) for a person who is allergic to nuts. Our research focused heavily on predicting wether a person likes a recipe or not. In this field, it is most important to reduce predictions which classify a recipe as 'liked', while in reality the person disliked the recipe (In our case, False Positives). Though it is also favorable to reduce prediction errors that fall into the False Negative category (especially if the person is a picky eater), such errors do not necessarily affect a good recipe schedule. It is worse to have disliked recipes show up on the schedule than missing out on some recipes that the person might have liked.
